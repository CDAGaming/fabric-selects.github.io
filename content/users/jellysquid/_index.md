I'm JellySquid.

That's a pen name. You probably haven't heard of me before, but your computer might be a bit more familiar. I'm a software engineer at heart, writing lean and mean code to power the virtual world around you.

I'm the Technical Lead at [Gilded Games](https://gildedgames.com/), working tirelessly on the highly-popular [Aether II](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/the-aether-ii) alongside my own personal projects in the space. I also have a history of contributing significant software optimizations to the open-source community.
